Let's suppose we have to update our Angular version i.e. for security reasons / new features.
However, some of your libraries can still use outdated Angular version.

As an example we'll consider the following Angular (already updated) modules' versions:

my-app => `package.json`
```json
"dependencies": {
    "@angular/common": "^14.2.0",
    "@angular/core": "^14.2.0",
    ...
    ...
}
```

While our lib contains constraints to have the following versions:

my-awesome-lib => `package.json`
```json
"peerDependencies": {
    "@angular/common": "^13.3.12",
    "@angular/core": "^13.3.12"
  }
```

In order to deal with this problem we can:
1. Wait & block our work till our `my-awesome-lib` supports Angular components in v.`^14.2.0` ðŸ‘Ž
2. `Override` these deps => enforce using versions we provide for the lib ðŸ¤©

In order to override our `my-awesome-lib` we'll need to include `overrides` object, with following possible configurations:

```json
"overrides": {
    "my-awesome-lib": {
      "@angular/common": "14.2.0",
      "@angular/core": "14.2.0"
    }
  }
```

```json
"overrides": {
    "my-awesome-lib": {
      "@angular/common": "^14.2.0",
      "@angular/core": "^14.2.0"
    }
  }
```

```json
"overrides": {
    "my-awesome-lib": {
      "@angular/common": "$@angular/common",
      "@angular/core": "$@angular/core"
    }
  }
```
