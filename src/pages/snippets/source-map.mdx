Do you want to upload source-map to an reporting tool like 
@datadoghq
, but want to make sure no one can debug the code due to sourceMap

Set below property in build options, the source-map will not be mapped to the bundle, but you will get a source map.

```json
"sourceMap": {
  "hidden": true,
}
```


<BlogImage src={SourceMap} alt="hidden source map for production" />
