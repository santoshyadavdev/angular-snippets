#### Goals:

The new syntax for template control flow has several major goals:

- Syntactically similar to JavaScript's control flow statement syntax.
- Syntactically distinct from HTML syntax.
- Works across multiple templates (if-elseif-else, switch-case-default), including template type-checking.
- Flexible syntax allowing customization for each use case (if vs for vs switch).
  Address common pain points.
- It must be possible to automatically migrate virtually all existing control flow usage to the new syntax.

### Conditional control flow uses blocks with the keywords if and else:

```typescript
{#if cond.expr}
  Main case was true!
{:else if other.expr}
  Extra case was true!
{:else}
  False case!
{/if}
```

### Switch control flow uses blocks with the keywords switch, case, and default:

```typescript
{#switch cond.kind}
  {:case x}
    X case
  {:case y}
    Y case
  {:case z}
    Z case
  {:default}
    No case matched
{/switch}
```

### Loop control flow uses blocks with the keywords for and empty:

```typescript
{#for item of items; track item.id}
  {{ item }}
{:empty}
  There were no items in the list.
{/for}
```

### Detailed Design

```typescript
{#if cond.expr}
  <child-cmp />
{/if}
```

### if block - conditionals

```typescript
{#if a > b}
  {{a}} is greater than {{b}}
{/if}
```

```typescript
{#if a > b}
  {{a}} is greater than {{b}}
{:else if b > a}
  {{a}} is less than {{b}}
{:else}
  {{a}} is equal to {{b}}
{/if}
```
