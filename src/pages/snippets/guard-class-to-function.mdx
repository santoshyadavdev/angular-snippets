Here is  simple example of how to translate a class guard into a functional guard.
Since version 14 of angular, and especially thanks to the possibility to use the inject function outside the injection context. It is now possible to write our Guards as a simple function.
With the arrival of Angular 15.2, writing guard as a class is now deprecated.

```typescript
import { Injectable } from '@angular/core';
import { Router, type CanActivate } from '@angular/router';
import { UserService } from './userService'

@Injectable({ provideIn:  'root' })
export class AuthenticationGuard implements CanActivate {
  constructor(
    private readonly userService: UserService,
    private readonly router: Router) {}

  canActivate(): Observable<boolean | UrlTree> {
    return this.userService.currentUser$.pipe(
        map(user => Boolean(user) ? 
          true : this.router.createUrlTree(['sign-in']))
    )
  }
}
```

In previous versions of Angular, this syntax was mandatory and particularly useful for injecting our services.

Thanks to the inject function, this class can be easily transformed into a function.

```typescript
import { Router, type CanActivateFn } from '@angular/router';
import { UserService } from './userService'

export function AuthenticationGuard(): CanActivateFn {
  const userService = inject(UserService);
  const router = inject(Router);

  return userService.currentUser$.pipe(
    map(user => Boolean(user) ?
      true : router.createUrlTree(['sign-in'])
  ))
}
```

The way to register your guard on a path has not changed; whether the guard is in the form of a class or a simple function the syntax of registration has not changed.

```typescript
import type Routes from '@angular/router';
import { HomeComponent } from './home.component';
import { SignInComponent } from './sign-in.component';
import { AuthenticationGuard } from './authentication-guard'

const routes: Routes = [
  { path: 'sign-in', component: SignInComponent }
  { path: 'home', component: HomeComponent, canActivate: [AuthenticationGuard]}
]
```
